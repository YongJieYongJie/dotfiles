# yongjieyongjie's dotfiles

Dotfiles and other configuration files for the various tools I use.

## Design concept

Files checked into the repository should be generally applicable across
machines. In other words, machine-specific dotfiles and configurations should
reside only on the applicable machines, and be loaded by the files in this
repository (see for example how  `.profile` loads
`~/.machine_specific_profile`.

## Use tools

Below are some of the useful tools I used (many of which are configured in the
.dotfiles.
